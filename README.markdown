Clamp
=====

"Clamp" is a minimal framework for command-line utilities.

It handles boring stuff like parsing the command-line, and generating help, so you can get on with making your command actually do stuff.

Not another one!
----------------

Yeah, sorry.  There are a bunch of existing command-line parsing libraries out there, and Clamp draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including [Thor], [optparse], and [Clip].  In the end, though, I wanted a slightly rounder wheel.

Quick Start
-----------

Clamp models a command as a Ruby class; a subclass of `Clamp::Command`.  They look something like this:

    class SpeakCommand < Clamp::Command

      option "--loud", :flag, "say it loud"
      option ["-n", "--iterations"], "N", "say it N times", :default => 1 do |s|
        Integer(s)
      end

      parameter "WORDS ...", "the thing to say", :attribute_name => :words

      def execute
        the_truth = words.join(" ")
        the_truth.upcase! if loud?
        iterations.times do
          puts the_truth
        end
      end

    end

Calling `run` on a command class creates an instance of it, then invokes it using command-line arguments (from ARGV, by default).

    SpeakCommand.run

Class-level methods like `option` and `parameter` declare attributes (in a similar way to `attr_accessor`), and arrange for them to be populated automatically based on command-line arguments.  They are also used to generate `help` documentation.

Declaring options
-----------------

Options are declared using the `option` method.  The three required arguments are:

  1. the option switch (or switches),
  2. an option argument name
  3. a short description

For example:

    option "--flavour", "FLAVOUR", "ice-cream flavour"

It works a little like `attr_accessor`, defining reader and writer methods on the command class.  The attribute name is derived from the switch (in this case, "`flavour`").  When you pass options to your command, Clamp will populate the attributes, which are then available for use in your `#execute` method.

    def execute
      puts "You chose #{flavour}.  Excellent choice!"
    end

If you don't like the inferred attribute name, you can override it:

    option "--type", "TYPE", "type of widget", :attribute_name => :widget_type
                                               # to avoid clobbering Object#type

### Short/long option switches

The first argument to `option` can be an array, rather than a single string, in which case all the switches are treated as aliases:

    option ["-s", "--subject"], "SUBJECT", "email subject line"

### Flag options

Some options are just boolean flags.  Pass "`:flag`" as the second parameter to tell Clamp not to expect an option argument:

    option "--verbose", :flag, "be chatty"

For flag options, Clamp appends "`?`" to the generated reader method; ie. you get a method called "`#verbose?`", rather than just "`#verbose`".

Negatable flags are easy to generate, too:

    option "--[no-]force", :flag, "be forceful (or not)"

Clamp will handle both "`--force`" and "`--no-force`" options, setting the value of "`#force?`" appropriately.

### Values from the environment

Sometimes you'll want to pass in option values from the environment:

    option "--port", "PORT", "the port to listen on", :environment_variable => "PORT" do |val|
      val.to_i
    end

The above means that in the absence of '--port' on the command line, Clamp will
check for `PORT` in the environment. This lets you do:

    % export PORT=8080 
    % ./mycommand

### Required options

While a 'required option' is a bit of an oxymoron, it is common to use options
as named parameters to your program. Clamp lets you make an option required:

    option "--password", "PASSWORD", "the secret password", :required => true

Special notes about required options:

* You may not use :required and :default values in the same option ('require' doesn't make sense if you provide a default)
* You may not use :required on :flag options. Since :flag options are boolean, a 'required flag' would mean "always true" ;)

Declaring parameters
--------------------

Positional parameters can be declared using `parameter`, specifying

  1. the parameter name, and
  2. a short description

For example:

    parameter "SRC", "source file"

Like options, parameters are implemented as attributes of the command, with the default attribute name derived from the parameter name (in this case, "`src`"). By convention, parameter names are specified in uppercase, to make them obvious in usage help.

### Optional parameters

Wrapping a parameter name in square brackets indicates that it's optional, e.g.

    parameter "[TARGET_DIR]", "target directory"

### Greedy parameters

Three dots at the end of a parameter name makes it "greedy" - it will consume all remaining command-line arguments.  For example:

    parameter "FILE ...", "input files"

The suffix "`_list`" is appended to the default attribute name for greedy parameters; in this case, an attribute called "`file_list`" would be generated.

Parsing and validation of options and parameters
------------------------------------------------

When you `#run` a command, it will first attempt to `#parse` command-line arguments, and map them onto the declared options and parameters, before invoking your `#execute` method.

Clamp will verify that all required (ie. non-optional) parameters are present, and signal a error if they aren't.

### Validation block

Both `option` and `parameter` accept an optional block.  If present, the block will be
called with the raw string option argument, and is expected to coerce it to
the correct type, e.g.

    option "--port", "PORT", "port to listen on" do |s|
      Integer(s)
    end

If the block raises an ArgumentError, Clamp will catch it, and report that the value was bad:

    !!!plain
    ERROR: option '--port': invalid value for Integer: "blah"

### Advanced option/parameter handling

While Clamp provides an attribute-writer method for each declared option or parameter, you always have the option of overriding it to provide custom argument-handling logic, e.g.

    parameter "SERVER", "location of server"

    def server=(server)
      @server_address, @server_port = server.split(":")
    end

### Default values

Default values can be specified for options, and optional parameters:

    option "--flavour", "FLAVOUR", "ice-cream flavour", :default => "chocolate"

    parameter "[HOST]", "server host", :default => "localhost"

For more advanced cases, you can also specify default values by defining a method called "`default_#{attribute_name}`":

    option "--http-port", "PORT", "web-server port", :default => 9000

    option "--admin-port", "PORT", "admin port"

    def default_admin_port
       http_port + 1
    end

### Environment variable support

Options (and optional parameters) can also be associated with environment variables:

    option "--port", "PORT", "the port to listen on", :environment_variable => "MYAPP_PORT" do |val|
      val.to_i
    end

    parameter "[HOST]", "server address", :environment_variable => "MYAPP_HOST"

Clamp will check the specified envariables in the absence of values supplied on the command line, before looking for a default value.

Declaring Subcommands
---------------------

Subcommand support helps you wrap a number of related commands into a single script (ala tools like "`git`").  Clamp will inspect the first command-line argument (after options are parsed), and delegate to the named subcommand.

Unsuprisingly, subcommands are declared using the `subcommand` method. e.g.

    class MainCommand < Clamp::Command

      subcommand "init", "Initialize the repository" do

        def execute
          # ...
        end

      end

    end

Clamp generates an anonymous subclass of the current class, to represent the subcommand.  Alternatively, you can provide an explicit subcommand class:

    class MainCommand < Clamp::Command

      subcommand "init", "Initialize the repository", InitCommand

    end

    class InitCommand < Clamp::Command

      def execute
        # ...
      end

    end

### Default subcommand

You can set a default subcommand, at the class level, as follows:

    class MainCommand < Clamp::Command

      self.default_subcommand = "status"

      subcommand "status", "Display current status" do

        def execute
          # ...
        end

      end

    end

Then, if when no SUBCOMMAND argument is provided, the default will be selected.

### Subcommand options and parameters

Options are inheritable, so any options declared for a command are supported for it's sub-classes (e.g. those created using `subcommand`).  Parameters, on the other hand, are not inherited - each subcommand must declare it's own parameter list.

Note that, if a subcommand accepts options, they must be specified on the command-line _after_ the subcommand name.

Getting help
------------

All Clamp commands support a "`--help`" option, which outputs brief usage documentation, based on those seemingly useless extra parameters that you had to pass to `option` and `parameter`.

    $ speak --help
    Usage:
        speak [OPTIONS] WORDS ...

    Arguments:
        WORDS ...                     the thing to say

    Options:
        --loud                        say it loud
        -n, --iterations N            say it N times (default: 1)
        -h, --help                    print help
